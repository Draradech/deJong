        This is a WebGPU renderer (using compute shaders) for the Peter de Jong attractor. This attractor was first
        published 1987 in Scientific American in an article by A. K. Dewdney as a reader submission (that reader being
        Peter de Jong). It was documented by Paul Bourke on his
        <a href="https://paulbourke.net/fractals/peterdejong/">website</a> and in "The Pattern Book: Fractals, Art and
        Nature" (1995). The color scheme, animation and this implementation are by
        <a href="https://github.com/Draradech">me</a>. The attractor is defined by an iterated function, calculating a
        coordinate on each iteration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>x2 = sin(a * y1) - cos(b * x1)</li>
        <li>y2 = sin(c * x1) - cos(d * y1)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These points jump around chaotically, but if you draw a small dot at each point (for millions of iterations)
        these unexpectedly detailed patterns appear. The colors are controlled by the difference from the last to the
        current point:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>red += abs(x2 - x1)</li>
        <li>green += abs(y2 - y1)</li>
        <li>blue += 1.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The animation is controlled by a global time parameter, from which the 4 attractor parameters are calculated
        like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a = 4 * sin(t * 1.03)</li>
        <li>b = 4 * sin(t * 1.07)</li>
        <li>c = 4 * sin(t * 1.09)</li>
        <li>d = 4 * sin(t * 1.13)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The compute shader runs short bursts of the attractor in each thread (from random starting points) to simulate
        sequential calculation. As the attractor is chaotic, starting over from a new random starting point is almost as
        good as continuing on. The implementation tries to scale the number of iterations to the available hardware.

        The info panel in the bottom right lists the timing and number of iterations for each shader pass. The graph in
        the bottomm left has: cyan - total number of iterations (log scale), green - frame time, red - total gpu time,
        yellow - javascript time, dark green / yellow / red - gpu time pass 1 / 2 / 3.
